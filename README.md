# Getting Started with Evinova Tv-series search application

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Installs all packages.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches jest tests.

### `npx cypress run`

Launches cypress tests in the console.

### `npx cypress open`

Launches cypress tests in the web browser.

## If I had more time, hereâ€™s what I would have done:

- Display a default placeholder image when the API does not provide an image for a TV serie.
- Set up CI to automate tests and code quality checks.
- For better performance and user experience, I would optimize images by using responsive sizes
- Deploy the application to a platform like Heroku or Netlify for easier sharing and testing.
- I would have ensured that the application is optimized for search engines by adding meta tags, improving accessibility mm
- Set up GitHub Actions or similar CI/CD tools to automate the deployment workflow.
- Improved the UI with animations
- Set up a clear branching strategy
- Increase test coverage by adding more unit tests and end to end test.
